## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: The 20 Newsgroups dataset is loaded using the `fetch_20newsgroups` function from the `sklearn.datasets` module.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Various feature extraction techniques, including CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, are applied to transform the text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
3. **Model Training**: The extracted features are used to train multiple classifiers, such as MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, SVM, and DecisionTree, using a pipeline approach.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: A grid search is performed to find the best combination of hyperparameters for each classifier and feature extraction technique.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using cross-validation and accuracy metrics to assess their performance on the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
