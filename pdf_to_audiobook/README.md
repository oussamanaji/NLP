## Methodology
1. **PDF Text Extraction**: The PyPDF2 library is used to extract text from PDF files, handling complex layouts and ensuring accurate retrieval of textual content.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: The extracted text undergoes preprocessing steps, such as removing special characters, handling line breaks, and filtering out irrelevant content.
3. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: The preprocessed text is converted into speech using the gTTS library, generating high-quality, natural-sounding audio.
4. **Audiobook Generation**: The generated audio is saved as an audiobook file format, such as MP3 or WAV, for easy playback and distribution.
5. **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface is provided to allow users to select PDF files, customize audiobook settings, and initiate the conversion process.
