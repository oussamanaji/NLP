# CausalNet: Enterprise-Focused Causal AI Framework

## Overview
CausalNet is a cutting-edge framework built on Cohere's aya-23-8B model, designed to enhance causal reasoning in enterprise AI applications. This project explores the integration of causal inference into large language models for improved decision-making in business contexts.

## Key Features
- Causal Inference Augmented Transformer (CIAT) layer
- Hierarchical Causal Curriculum Learning
- Enterprise-focused causal reasoning tasks

## Results
- 82% accuracy in supply chain optimization scenarios
- 23% improvement in complex causal reasoning tasks

## Usage
[Colab notebook in progress]

## Future Work
- Integrate real-time data streams for dynamic causal model updates
- Explore multi-modal causal reasoning by incorporating visual and textual data
- Develop industry-specific causal templates for faster deployment in various sectors
- Investigate the potential of quantum computing for enhancing causal inference speed
- Implement explainable AI techniques to provide transparent causal reasoning paths
- Expand the framework to support causal discovery in complex, high-dimensional datasets
