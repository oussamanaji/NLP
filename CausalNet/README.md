## 🌟 Overview

CausalNet is an innovative framework designed to enhance the causal reasoning capabilities of large language models, with a focus on enterprise applications. Built upon Cohere's `aya-23-8B` model, CausalNet implements a multi-faceted approach to improve AI's understanding and application of causal relationships in business contexts.

In an era where data-driven decision-making is crucial for business success, CausalNet aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation, providing enterprises with a powerful tool for strategic planning and analysis.

## 🚀 Key Components

CausalNet integrates several cutting-edge components to deliver a comprehensive causal AI solution:

- **HCCL**: Hierarchical Causal Curriculum Learning
- **CIAT**: Causal Inference Augmented Transformer
- **MCR**: Multi-Modal Causal Representation
- **ACRT**: Adversarial Causal Robustness Training
- **ECRT**: Explainable Causal Reasoning Traces
- **MLCA**: Meta-Learning for Causal Abstraction
- **CKIS**: Causal Knowledge Integration System

Each component plays a crucial role in enhancing the model's causal reasoning capabilities, ensuring robust and interpretable results for enterprise applications.
