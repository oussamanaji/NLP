## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Overview
Explore the advanced field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through a series of cutting-edge projects designed to solve real-world problems. This category features an array of projects that leverage both classical NLP techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning models to derive meaningful insights from textual data.

### Projects

**1. LDA-based Topic Modeling Engine for News Articles**
- **Description**: This project employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to reveal hidden themes and topics in extensive news article collections. It integrates advanced summarization techniques like TextRank and BART to produce concise and coherent summaries of the identified topics, enabling a quick grasp of the main points discussed.
- **Technologies**: LDA, TextRank, BART
- **Applications**: Topic discovery, text summarization, news analysis

**2. Multi-Technique Text Classification System**
- **Description**: Demonstrating the efficacy of ensemble methods, this project combines multiple feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms to achieve superior accuracy in text classification tasks. It utilizes approaches such as CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, alongside classifiers like MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, SVM, and DecisionTree.
- **Technologies**: CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, SVM, DecisionTree
- **Applications**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, document categorization

**3. Comprehensive Text Summarization Toolkit**
- **Description**: This project offers a versatile toolkit for text summarization, featuring extractive methods like TextRank and LexRank as well as cutting-edge abstractive models such as BART and PEGASUS. It provides a unified interface to generate summaries from various text sources, facilitating the quick extraction of key information from lengthy documents.
- **Technologies**: TextRank, LexRank, BART, PEGASUS
- **Applications**: Text summarization, information distillation, document processing

**4. CRF-based Prescription Parser**
- **Description**: Addressing the challenge of extracting structured information from unstructured medical prescriptions, this project employs Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to accurately identify and classify entities such as medication names, dosages, and frequencies. It highlights the potential of NLP in automating the parsing of complex medical documents, thereby improving efficiency and reducing errors in healthcare settings.
- **Technologies**: CRF
- **Applications**: Medical document parsing, information extraction, healthcare automation
